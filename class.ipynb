    "- It is a set of instrutions to complete a task\n",
    "- When we talk about computer science, algorithm is a solution for a common problem\n",
    "    - Someone had already come up with a solution for a specific problem of the field\n",
    "- Why is it important?\n",
    "    - If you are looking to solve a problem, you might use a solution already available\n",
    "    - There is a likelihood your own solution won't be as good as the algorithm already in use\n",
    "- It is important not only to know about an algorithm but also when to apply it\n",
    "    - That is called algorithm thinking\n",
    "- Searching numbers\n",
    "    - Linear search / Simple search / Sequential search\n",
    "        - Look for a number counting one after another\n",
    "            - Example: to guessa the number 50, the individual would count from 1 up to 50\n",

    "- So what makes an algorithm an algorithm?\n",
    "    - It follows a step by step rule\n",
    "    - And also there is a clear problem statement, input and output\n",
    "    - We have a problem and a specific set of steps in particular order to solve it\n",
    "    - The steps need to be very distinct\n",
    "    - The algorithm needs to produce a result\n",
    "    - The algorith should complete in a finite amount of time\n",
    "    - Executing an algorithm with a given result must result in the same output everytime\n",
    "    - When an algorithm follows above steps, it's reached one of its main features: correctness\n",
    "- Efficiency\n",
    "    - There are 2 measures that indicate efficiency\n",
    "        - Time\n",
    "            - The less time you take, the more efficient you are\n",
    "        - Space\n",
    "            - The amount of memory taken to complete the task\n",
    "    - The right way to evaluate efficioncy is by checking the worst case scenario"
